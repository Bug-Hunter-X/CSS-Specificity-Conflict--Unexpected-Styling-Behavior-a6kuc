# CSS Specificity Conflict
This example demonstrates a common issue in CSS where specificity conflicts lead to unexpected styling behavior. The problem arises from the way CSS selectors are evaluated, where more specific selectors override less specific ones, even if declared later. 

## Bug
The main issue lies in the fact that the `#myElement p` selector is more specific than the `.myClass p` selector because of the ID selector (`#myElement`). As a result, the color of the paragraph is overridden to blue, regardless of the `.myClass p` declaration appearing later in the stylesheet.

## Solution
The solution is to ensure there are no conflicts by modifying either the selectors or the order. The solution file shows two approaches: increasing the specificity of the desired rule or using the `!important` flag.  Using `!important` is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary because it can lead to more complex debugging.
